	[ ] need to redesign 'stock_items' db table
		- each item to have its own row
		- major refactor !?!?!?!

	[ ] finish up 'actionDisposition()' in QuotesController

	[x] if part needs to be approved, doesn't get added/displayed 
		in items table until page gets refreshed

	[ ] Quote status should depend on individual items
		- as items get approved, change status if there are no more to be approved

	[ ] should be able to edit other items on quote that
		don't need approval

    [ ] user needs to be able to edit custom price

    [ ] when approver views items on a quote that needs approval, 
    	- clicking on item brings up popup with part details
    	- clicking on 'edit item' shows 'approve'/'reject' icon (thumbs up/down?)

    [x] on edit item page, change input to textarea and show previous comments, 
        then append any new ones (prefix with name:)
