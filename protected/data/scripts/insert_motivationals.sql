... will I be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.

... will I be content with mediocrity.

... will I ignore the devil in the details.

... will I assume that 'no' means 'no forever'

... will I allow my competitor to take care of my customer

... will I just talk about what I want to accomplish; I will make it happen.

... will I settle for anything less than my best

... will I be a 'crocodile' salesperson (big mouth, no ears)

... will I let the past remind me of what I am not now

... will I think inside the box
